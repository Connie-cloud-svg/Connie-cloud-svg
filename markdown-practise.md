## My Learning Goals
### This Semester.
**Markdown** is the first formatting language I need to learn on *GitHub* `very important`.

Also I'll learn some additional helpful coding languages on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

Here on GitHub, for starters I want to learn: 
- How to make Repositories.
- How to code here.
So far I have learnt how to make a commit and the steps are:
  1. **Stage your changes:** Choose which modified files to include in the commit.
  2. **Create the commit.** Run the commit command with a descriptive message.
  3. **Push to GitHub.** Upload your local commit to the remote repository.
     
Tools I will use;

   |Tool      | Purpose    | Link                           |
   |----------|------------|--------------------------------|
   |VS Code   | Editor     | https://code.visualstudio.com/ |
   | Copilot  | Suggestions| https://github.com/copilot     |
   
Tasks;
  - [x] GitHub and Git Introduction.
  - [x] Creating a ReadMe profile.
  - [x] Creating a Repository.
  - [ ] Pulling repositories.
```python
print(" I find GitHub to be one of the most user friendly tools for a programmer or any developer.")
```
> *Learning without practice is a waste of time.*

## Soo, get to know me a little:
**HI! I'm Connie,**
*A beginner in this space*

I have tried some coding languages i.e:

 1. Python on (w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp)
 2. HTML on (w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
Looking forward to more learning 😁😁.

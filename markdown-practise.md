## My Learning Goals
### This Semester.
**Markdown** first formatting language I need to learn on *GitHub* `very important`.
Learn some additional helpful coding languages on [Link text](https://www.w3schools.com/)
I want to learn: 
- How to make Repositories.
- How to code here.
So far I have learnt how to make a commit and the steps are,
1. **Stage your changes:** Choose which modified files to include in the commit.
2. **Create the commit.** Run the commit command with a descriptive message.
3. **Push to GitHub.** Upload your local commi to the remote repository.
Tools I will use;
   | Tool           | Purpose         | Link                                            |
   |----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
   | VS Code        | Editor          | [Link text](code.visualstudio.com.)             |
   | GitHub Copilot | Code Suggestion | [Link text]https://github.com/features/copilot |
Tasks;
  - [x] GitHub and Git Introduction.
  - [x] Creating a ReadMe profile.
  - [x] Creating a Repository.
  - [ ] Pulling repositories.
